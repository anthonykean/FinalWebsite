  <h2>Roster Changes</h2>

  <div class="box"><h1>Pro Canes</h1><p>Starting Wide Reciever and leading playmaker Braxton Berrios is onto the NFL after graduating from UM. Berrios was a key contributor to the canes as a WR and special teams return man. Along with Berrios, starting Running back Mark Walton Jr., Left tackle K.C. Mcdermott, and Tight end Chris Herdnon Jr. all declared for the NFL draft. On the defensive side, two key Canes that are moving onto the NFL are defensive tackles Kendrick Norton Jr. and R.J. Mcintosh.  </p></div>

  <div class="box"><h1>Quarterback Competition</h1><p>Malik Rosier was the Quarterback for the Hurricanes last season, and he is expected to compete for the job with N'Kosi Perry and Freshman Jarren Williams. Rosier started all 13 games for Miami last season, but one flaw was his inability to protect the football. Rosier threw 14 interceptions last season.</p></div>

  <div class="box"><h1>Career Ending Injury</h1><p>Starting Cornerback Malek Young was forced to retire due to a neck injury sustained in the bowl game versus Wisconsin.</p> </div>

  <div class="box"><h1>Depleated D-Line?</h1><p>One area the canes will need to step up at is on the defensive line. If losing Kendrick Norton Jr., R.J. Mcintosh, and Chad Thomas wasn't enough, highly respected defensive line coach Craig Kuligowski left the Canes for a job with the University of Alabama. Kuligowski was replaced by Atlanta Falcons assistant coach Jess Simpson.</p></div>
