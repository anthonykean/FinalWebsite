  <h2>Upcoming Season</h2>

<div class="box"><h1>Key Contributor Returning from Injury</h1><p>This upcoming season the Canes expect Wide Reciever Ahmmon Richards to return to form after ending his season with knee surgery. Richards hopes to dominate when returning to the field in hopes to help his draft stock and show scouts his abilities. During his freshman year, Richards led the Canes with 49 receptions with 934 yards and 3 touchdowns.</p></div>

  <div class="box"><h1>Defensive Strengths</h1><p>A few areas on the Canes defense that are expected to be stout are the Linebackers and the Safeties. Shaq Quarterman, Michael Pinckney, Zach McCloud, Jaquan Johnson, and Sheldrick Redwine to name a few are all returning and have high expectations. All are leaders from the previous team, key contributors and players that all cannot wait to put the turnover chain back on. Yes, the turnover chain is not going anywhere, and will be back this season.</p></div>

  <div class="box"><h1>Position Battle</h1><p>One key psoition battle for Miami is at Running back after Mark Walton Jr. declared for the draft after missing the remainder of the 2017 season with an ankle injury. Travis Homer replaced Walton Jr. for the remainder of the season and performed well. The reason this position is impreticularly intriguing is because of the 5 star recruit the Canes landed in this years recruiting class. Top recruit Lorenzo Lingard is expected to compete for playing time right away, and currently is the only 5 star recruit on the entire team.</p></div>

  <div class="box"><h1>Key Games</h1><p>Week 1 will definitely be important for Miami squaring off against LSU in a non conference game. After that the Canes should be able to dominate until week 6 when FSU comes to town. The final two weeks of the season will be important going on the road to Virginia Tech, and than hosting Pitt the team that ended their perfect season a year ago.
  </div>

<div class="box"><h1>Canes out for Revenge?</h1><p>In 2017 the Canes lost their final 3 games of the season. Pittsburgh, Clemson, and than Wisconsin. Some good news for Miami, is that they will get a rematch against the Pitt Panthers late in the 2018 season. A sucessful regular season could infact put the Canes in position for some revenge against Clemson, or Wisconsin by playing in a bowl game, or even making it into the college football playoff. No matter what, 3 losses was an improvement from many previous seasons, and with that the Canes are expected to continue to improve this season. With last years success, the Canes will be ranked top 10 to begin the 2018 season with high expectations to build upon last year. </p></div>
